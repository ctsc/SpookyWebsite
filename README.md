The Last Halloween - Interactive Story
A simple, interactive story website built for a class competition. This project is a demonstration of what can be achieved using only HTML and CSS.

## Description ðŸ“œ
"The Last Halloween" is a short, clickable mystery story where the user investigates why Halloween was canceled in their town. You gather clues from different locations and perform a ritual to break a curse and save the holiday.

The main challenge and goal of this project was to create an engaging, multi-page experience without using any JavaScript. All interactivity, animations, and page transitions are handled purely with CSS.


CODE IS IN MASTER BRANCH!!!
