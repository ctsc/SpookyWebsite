# 🎃 The Last Halloween - Interactive Story

A simple, interactive story website built for a class competition. This project is a demonstration of what can be achieved using **only HTML and CSS**.

***

## ## Description 📜

"The Last Halloween" is a short, clickable mystery story where the user investigates why Halloween was canceled in their town. You gather clues from different locations and perform a ritual to break a curse and save the holiday.

The main challenge and goal of this project was to create an engaging, multi-page experience **without using any JavaScript**. All interactivity, animations, and page transitions are handled purely with CSS.

## ## Features ✨
